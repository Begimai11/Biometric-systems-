Face recognition sytem
Face recognition systems typically follow a three-step process:
- Extraction
- Analysis
- Matching
We have used the pre-trained Keras FaceNet model. It was trained on MS-Celeb-1M dataset and expects input images to be color, to have their pixel values whitened (standardized across all three channels), and to have a square shape of 160×160 pixels.
